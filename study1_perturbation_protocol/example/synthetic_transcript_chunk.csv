00:00:15,15,Speaker_A,"Okay, let's start with the update on the supplier negotiation."
00:00:42,42,Speaker_B,"So we had the meeting with them on Friday. They sent over a commercial proposal, but it came in much higher than we expected. About 40% over our budget ceiling."
00:01:10,70,Speaker_A,"40%? That's a significant gap. Did they give any room for negotiation?"
00:01:28,88,Speaker_B,"They said the numbers were 'flexible', but we don't have a clear counter-proposal yet. We need to decide how to respond."
00:02:05,125,Speaker_C,"I just want to make sure I understand — are we talking about the unit cost or the total contract value?"
00:02:20,140,Speaker_B,"The total contract value for the first six months."
00:02:35,155,Speaker_A,"Okay. And what about the regulatory approval we were waiting for? Any news?"
00:03:01,181,Speaker_C,"That's actually the other thing I wanted to bring up. I got a message this morning that the approval process has been suspended indefinitely due to a new internal review policy they just implemented."
00:03:40,220,Speaker_A,"Suspended indefinitely? That blocks our entire Q3 launch plan."
00:03:55,235,Speaker_B,"Exactly. We cannot move forward with the pilot without that approval. We're completely blocked on that front."
00:04:20,260,Speaker_A,"Alright. Given this, I think we need to formally drop the Q3 target and pivot to Q4. We can't commit to a timeline we have no control over."
00:04:55,295,Speaker_C,"Agreed. Let's also flag this as a risk for the board update next week."
00:05:10,310,Speaker_B,"One more thing — the user testing we ran last week. We had 12 participants, and 10 of them reported that the onboarding flow was confusing. That's way higher than the 20% threshold we set."
00:05:45,345,Speaker_A,"That's a clear failure signal. We need to go back to the design team before we can even think about scaling."
